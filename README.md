 Kaggle-Disease_prediction_project
This project focuses on predicting diseases based on a given set of symptoms using machine learning models. The data comes from the Kaggle dataset, and the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts a disease based on the symptoms a patient exhibits.
Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Key Components:
Data Analysis:

Checking for missing values in the dataset.
Analyzing feature distributions using bar plots.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values using Simple Imputer.
Label encoding for categorical variables.
Standard scaling for numerical features.
Modeling:

Models used: Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Training and evaluation using accuracy metrics.
Validation:

Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model evaluation using accuracy score to assess the performance of different classifiers.
